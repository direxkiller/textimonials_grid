                        <h4>Verified Graduate</h4>
                        <p> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
                            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>
                        <p>‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
                            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                            the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                        <p>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</p>
                        <p> ‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
                            for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>

                <h4>Verified Graduate</h4>
                <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                <p>‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                    could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                    100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
